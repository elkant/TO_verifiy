# TO_verifiy
 A module for tracking and verifying completeness of PLHIVs transfer Out across different Facilities
 
 ***Patients Transfer out verification Module Across Different Health Facilities**

MOH Kenya through Nascop requires that patients living with HIV AIDS who request to transfer out and start picking ARV drugs to another Facility should have 
a verification done on whether the transfer out process was complete or not.

****Definition of a Complete Transfer out***:
When a PLHIV reports to the transferring Facility with a letter from the reffered facility and picks drugs within the expected Next Clinical Appointment date,
 then thats a complete Tranfer Out


*****Problem Statement****:
Most of the patients have not been reporting on time to transferring facility on the indicated effective Transfer Out date 
For the few that do, the process has not been done on a timely basis.
Clinicians have had to do manual follow ups on whether the patient arrived to the destination facility.
It has also not been easy to get ccc Contact information for specific facility inchanrges to enquire about the transfer outs

*****Solution******:
Develop a Tranfer out verification platform where when a patient is reffered from Facility X to Y, a notification is send to the Contact Person for clinic Y
and once the patient arrives, the verification is completed
Once the patient arrives on the receiving person in Clinic Y and the transfer out is complete

**Update each Facilities Contact Person infor**
Patient Name


**Reports**
-Track the refferals of the transfer out
